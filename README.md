# WeaponSFXByFaceplateVTT

A library of weapon sound effects intended for tabletop games (e.g. modern-war / military / horror RPGs) using VTT.

## What is this

This repo provides a collection of royalty-free realistic sfx files (gunshots, reloads, heavy weaponry etc.) collected all over from Internet suitable for modern warfare settings. Useful for games like Delta Green, T2K or similar.

## Why use it

- Consistent style useful for gritty/military or modern-war/cold-war tabletop RPG atmospheres.  
- Easy to drop into a VTT setup.

## Getting Started...?

- Clone or download this repository... you're done! You may wish to refer to Moulinette Soundboard for FoundryVTT or other equivalent modules to actually implement these into your game.
